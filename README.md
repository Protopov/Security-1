This course is designed to teach you fundamental cyber security concepts to kick-start your security learning. It is vendor agnostic and is divided into small lessons that should take around 30-60 mins to complete. Each lesson has a small quiz and links to further reading if you want to dive into the topic a bit more.

When you have finished this course, you can move onto some of our Microsoft Learn modules. We recommend you continue your learning with  [Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/describe-concepts-of-security-compliance-identity/?WT.mc_id=academic-96948-sayoung) Ultimately, you could consider taking the [Exam SC-900: Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals exam.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/sc-900/?WT.mc_id=academic-96948-sayoung)
